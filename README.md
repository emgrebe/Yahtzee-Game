## Description of Game

### ~After clicking the 'Roll Dice' button, the 4 random dice will pop up. You can decide to either select the dice of your choice, or roll again.
### ~Each game consists of 8 rounds, with 3 rolls in each round.
### ~After your 3 rolls, you must click a score box that matches your dice selected, and when clicked, the total of the selected dice will show up in that box.
### ~Once you select your box, click the 'Next Round' button to go to the next round.

## What I Would Like To Change

### ~I would really like to improve upon the complexity of the game. With having a deadline, I wanted to make sure I had the basic setup for my game and make sure everything worked properly. 
### ~I would eventually like to add another die and add the upper total score, bonus, small straight, chance, three of a kind, and four of a kind.
